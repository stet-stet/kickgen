# kickgen
unsupervised learning fun with ~9k kick samples. **This repo does not contain the dataset nor the final model.**

# TODO

 * gather kick samples from whatever sources I can think of
 * Train a Wavenet
 * Train a VAE
 * Train a Wavenet Vocoder
 * Using the codes I wrote while tackling the tasks above, do something original and good.
 
# Notes

Not all of the kicks in my in-house dataset were gathered legally. 
Therefore, Redistribution of my in-house dataset would constitute a direct infringement of applicable copyright laws.
